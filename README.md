### Project 2 - Sales Rocket Initial Proof of Concept Dashboard


#### Project Introduction
A startup called Sales_Rocket wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on their sales across the nation. Management has a few questions they’d like easy access to. Currently, they answer these questions through spreadsheets scattered about and a variety of different tools. Unfortunately, none of the spreadsheets and tools neatly combine all their answers into one.
They would like a dashboard designer to go through each question and try to come up with a way to display their data in a way that is neat and intuitive, even for the less data-savvy among them.

#### Project Overview
In this project, you will apply what you have learned about designing with your audience in mind to build a useful dashboard prototype. To complete the project, you will need to create a prototype that allows users to intuitively answer the series of questions below. You can use any modern dashboarding tool you would like. You are free to use Tableau. For this project, you will be using the Superstore dataset.

#### Project Deliverable
- Initial Sketches and Wireframes before creating the Dashboard for the client
- Provide proof of concept Dashboard that satisfies requirements of management by providing an easily accessible, neat and intuitive way to display their data.

### Project 3 - Sales Rocket Final Dashboard

#### Project Introduction

The first tactical dashboard for Sales_Rocket was a hit. Now the full executive team wants a more strategic view of the business. You need to create a dashboard that allows the team to see: • Top-level revenue, profit, average profit ratio and units sold • YoY performance by segment (segment refers to Corporate, Consumer, Home Office) • Monthly trend of the current year by segment (segment refers to Corporate, Consumer, Home Office) • View category performance • Best performing sub-category within each customer segment The difference between this dashboard and the previous, besides the content, is the emphasis on performance. Your executive audience does not have the time to make all the comparisons themselves. They need you to emphasize the main points of interest they will relay to their team leads for further investigation and discuss among themselves regarding strategy. 

#### Project Deliverable
Provide production ready interactive Dashboard that meets all requirements of the Executive team.
